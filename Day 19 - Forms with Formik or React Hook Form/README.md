# Day 19 – Forms with Formik / React Hook Form

Managing forms manually in React can quickly get verbose and error-prone.

Libraries like **Formik** and **React Hook Form** simplify form validation, submission, and performance.

---

## ✨ Key Concepts

✅ **Formik** simplifies form state, validation, and error handling  
✅ Works well with Yup for schema-based validation  
✅ **React Hook Form (RHF)** uses uncontrolled components by default  
✅ RHF is more performant especially in large forms  
✅ Both libraries offer field-level validation, touched states, and error reporting  
✅ RHF works seamlessly with TypeScript

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Rewriting form logic instead of using existing libraries  
❌ Forgetting to register fields in RHF  
❌ Not handling default values properly  
❌ Mixing controlled and uncontrolled inputs inappropriately  
❌ Overcomplicating small forms with heavy libraries

❓ What are the benefits of RHF’s uncontrolled approach?  
❓ How does validation work in Formik vs RHF?  
❓ Can you integrate Yup or Zod with both?  
❓ Which is better for performance and why?

## Mini Exercise

Build a form with two inputs (name + email) using React Hook Form  
Show error if the email is invalid and display values on submit.
